# TIGER-Plus
Model based test script generation framework with optimization of abstract test cases leveraging machine learning techniques and algorithms

**Suggested Improvements**

While the project is functional, here are a few suggestions for future development and code enhancement:

Modularization: Break down large components or functions into smaller, reusable modules to improve readability and maintenance.

Error Handling: Add more comprehensive error handling throughout the app, particularly for file handling.

Code Cleanup: Remove duplicate classes and implementations that were added for experimentation but are no longer in use. These currently clutter the codebase and may lead to confusion or unintended behavior.

Testing: Include unit and integration tests using tools like xUnit or NUnit to ensure code reliability.

Code Comments and Documentation: Improve inline documentation and add docstrings to complex functions.

Performance Optimization: Refactor any inefficient algorithms or data structures identified (e.g., using maps for faster lookups).

UI Enhancements: Improve the front-end UI for a more polished and user-friendly experience i.e. converting the project in WPF.
